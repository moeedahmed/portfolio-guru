## Conversation States

| State constant      | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `IDLE`              | No active conversation. Waiting for any input.               |
| `AWAIT_FORM_CHOICE` | Form type buttons shown. Waiting for user to select a form.  |
| `AWAIT_APPROVAL`    | Draft preview shown. Waiting for File / Edit / Cancel.       |
| `AWAIT_EDIT_FIELD`  | Edit mode. Waiting for user to select which field to change. |
| `AWAIT_EDIT_VALUE`  | Edit mode. Waiting for user to provide the new field value.  |
| `AWAIT_USERNAME`    | Setup flow. Waiting for Kaizen username.                     |
| `AWAIT_PASSWORD`    | Setup flow. Waiting for Kaizen password.                     |

**Invariant:** Every path to `ConversationHandler.END` must call `context.user_data.clear()` first.

## Flow 1 — First-Time User

```
/start
→ Welcome message + [What is this? | Connect Kaizen | File a case]

[What is this?]
→ Explain message
→ Return to idle (no state change)

[Connect Kaizen]
→ has_credentials(user_id)?
  YES → "Kaizen already connected ✅" + [File a case] button
  NO  → Ask for Kaizen username → AWAIT_USERNAME
        → Ask for Kaizen password → AWAIT_PASSWORD
        → Encrypt + store in SQLite
        → "Connected ✅" + [File a case] button

[File a case]
→ has_credentials(user_id)?
  NO  → "Please connect Kaizen first" + [Connect Kaizen] button
  YES → "Send me your case" prompt → waiting for text/voice/photo
```

---

## Flow 2 — Core Filing (Happy Path)

```
User sends input (text / voice / photo)
→ classify_intent(text)
  CHITCHAT → friendly reply, return to idle
  QUESTION → answer_question(text), return to idle
  CASE     → proceed

Detect input type:
  text  → use as-is
  voice → whisper.transcribe() → text
  photo → vision.extract_from_image() → text

→ recommend_form_types(text)
  Returns list of FormTypeRecommendation objects (max 3)
  Each has: form_type, uuid, reason

→ Show buttons: one per recommended form + [❌ Cancel]
  State → AWAIT_FORM_CHOICE

User taps [❌ Cancel]
→ "Cancelled." context.user_data.clear() → END

User taps [form type]
→ extract_cbd_data(text, form_type)
  Returns CBDData with all fields:
  date, setting, presentation, clinical_reasoning,
  reflection (humanized), slos, key_capabilities
→ Store in context.user_data['draft']
→ Show draft preview message
→ Show [✅ File this draft | ✏️ Edit | ❌ Cancel]
   State → AWAIT_APPROVAL

[❌ Cancel]
→ context.user_data.clear() → END

[✏️ Edit]
→ Flow 3 (Edit Before Filing)

[✅ File this draft]
→ filer.file_form(draft, credentials)
  browser-use opens Kaizen
  navigates to: https://kaizenep.com/events/new-section/<UUID>
  fills all fields
  clicks "Save as Draft" ONLY — never submits to supervisor
  SUCCESS → "✅ Saved as draft in Kaizen" + [✅ Done | 📤 File another]
  FAILURE → "❌ Filing failed: <error>" + [🔁 Retry | ❌ Cancel]

[✅ Done]
→ context.user_data.clear() → END

[📤 File another]
→ context.user_data.clear() → "Send me your next case" → idle
```

## Flow 2A — Assess Ticket (Read-Only Mapping / Planned)

This is the assessor-side equivalent of Flow 2. It is not a persistent "mode";
it is a second entry point into the same review-and-approve engine.

```
Ticket appears in assessor portfolio
→ Portfolio Guru notification: "You have a ticket awaiting assessment"
→ User opens ticket from bot or Kaizen link
→ Bot extracts ticket content read-only
→ Bot shows:
   - ticket type
   - trainee/doctor details visible on the ticket
   - ticket fields and attachments metadata
   - Kaizen link as backup
→ Assessor gives intent:
   "Looks fine, sign it"
   "Ask them to add more reflection"
   "Mention clearer clinical reasoning"
   "Approve but add X"
→ Bot drafts assessor feedback/sign-off text
→ Bot shows missing assessor fields or risk notes if present
→ Bot shows draft response
→ User approves one named action
→ Bot submits/signs that one assessor action
```

Current implementation status:

```
Read-only mapping scaffold exists:
  backend/assessor_mapper.py
  backend/assessor_reader.py
  backend/state_tracker.py
  backend/supervisor_poller.py
  backend/role_detector.py
  backend/supervisor_workflow.py    # orchestration seam

Allowed during mapping:
  - navigate to Assessments timeline
  - list visible assessment rows (now also records `fill_action`)
  - open ticket detail pages
  - extract read-only fields, tags, state, visible buttons
  - output PHI-free ticket shapes for mapping

Backend integration landed in this slice:
  - Account role cached per Telegram user (profile_store.kaizen_role)
    via supervisor_workflow.set_role_if_better — refuses to demote a
    known-good "assessor"/"trainee" cache to "unknown" on a flaky probe.
  - setup_password persists the canonical role after a successful login
    (one new line; trainee setup behaviour unchanged).
  - supervisor_workflow.run_supervisor_poll is a callable, fully tested
    orchestrator: refreshes role, gates on role=="assessor", polls the
    queue via supervisor_poller, returns PHI-free
    SupervisorNotificationPayload objects. Not yet scheduled.
  - supervisor_workflow.render_supervisor_notification_text /
    render_supervisor_ticket_detail_text are pure formatters ready for
    the bot to drop into a future /supervisor command.

Not built yet:
  - periodic scheduler that drives run_supervisor_poll on a 5-min tick
  - Telegram /supervisor command + Open/Skip callbacks
  - assessor feedback capture (voice/text → assessor fields)
  - draft save on assessor side
  - any submit/sign action (out of scope by safety contract)
```

First mapped read-only ticket shape:

```
Ticket type: CBD - Case Based Discussion (2025 update)
Route: view-section
Visible read-only fields:
  - Date occurred on
  - End date
  - Case to be discussed
  - Attach files
Write-side controls detected but not clicked:
  - Fill in
  - Save
Implication:
  - The next mapping gap is the post-Fill in assessor form. Opening it may create
    or modify assessor-side state, so it stays blocked until an explicit
    one-ticket approval gate exists.
```

First mapped assessor completion shape after explicit approval:

```
Ticket type: CBD - Case Based Discussion (2025 update)
Route after Fill in: fillin
Assessor-side fields/inputs:
  - Assessor Registration Number
  - Job title
  - Entrustment Scale
  - Feedback
  - Recommendation for further learning or development
Write-side controls detected but not clicked:
  - Submit
  - Save as draft
Product implication:
  - Assessor action can use the same draft/review/approve engine as filing,
    but final submit must remain a one-ticket explicit approval action.
```

## Flow 2B — Portfolio Readiness / ARCP Health (Planned)

Canonical product spec: `docs/ARCP_HEALTH_DESIGN.md`.

This is a planning/readiness flow, not a Kaizen filing flow.

```
User opens Portfolio Readiness
→ confirm training stage, curriculum/requirement preset, and review date if known
→ user manually adds or updates evidence items
→ user maps evidence to domains/SLOs/KCs, or confirms assistant-suggested mappings
→ bot/web shows readiness status with concrete reasons and uncertainties
→ user can generate a draft review pack for supervisor discussion
```

MVP boundaries:

- no Kaizen login, scraping, import, browser automation, or submission
- no supervisor request
- no ARCP success claim
- manual/user-entered evidence first
- "uploaded", "reviewed", and "accepted" are separate user-controlled statuses
- readiness labels must always show the supporting gaps/reasons

---

## Flow 3 — Edit Before Filing

```
Entry: user tapped [✏️ Edit] from AWAIT_APPROVAL state

→ "Which field to edit?" + field buttons:
  [Date | Setting | Presentation | Clinical reasoning | Reflection | SLOs | ❌ Back]
  State → AWAIT_EDIT_FIELD

[❌ Back]
→ Re-show draft preview + approval buttons
  State → AWAIT_APPROVAL

[field selected]
→ "Send me the new value for <field>"
  State → AWAIT_EDIT_VALUE

User sends text
→ Update context.user_data['draft'][field] = new_value
→ Re-show updated draft preview
→ Re-show [✅ File this draft | ✏️ Edit | ❌ Cancel]
  State → AWAIT_APPROVAL
```

---

## Flow 4 — Edit Previously Filed Draft (v2.1 — NOT YET BUILT)

```
User says "edit my last case" or similar
→ Query case_history table in SQLite by user_id
  FOUND     → Show summary + [Yes, this one | No, different one]
  NOT FOUND → "No matching case found. Describe it more."

[Yes, this one]
→ browser-use opens Kaizen draft URL
→ Show current field values
→ Enter Flow 3 (Edit)

[No, different one]
→ Prompt again
```

---

## Flow 5 — Reset / Recovery

```
User sends /reset (any state)
→ context.user_data.clear()
→ "Reset. Send me a case whenever you're ready."
→ END (returns to idle)

User sends a new case while mid-state (stuck)
→ classify_intent → CASE
→ If AWAIT_APPROVAL or AWAIT_EDIT_*:
    "Looks like a new case. Send /reset to start fresh."
→ If IDLE:
    proceed normally
```

---

## Form Type Decision Rules

Applied inside `recommend_form_types()` in `extractor.py`.

```
CBD — always include if any clinical case was managed by the trainee.

DOPS — include ONLY IF:
  - Trainee directly performed a procedure with their own hands
  - Procedure is invasive: LP, intubation, central line, chest drain, cardioversion, etc.
  - Do NOT include if trainee only observed or assisted

LAT — include ONLY IF:
  - Trainee explicitly led a team, coordinated a resus, or managed a major incident
  - Must be active leadership, not just being present as senior
  - Do NOT include for routine senior clinical decision-making

ACAT — include ONLY IF:
  - Description covers a full shift assessment or multiple patients across a shift
  - Not for a single case

ACAF — include ONLY IF:
  - Acute care assessment in a non-traditional setting explicitly described

Max 3 forms recommended per case.
Adjacent ≠ demonstrated. When in doubt, exclude.
```

---

## Key Capabilities Selection Rules

Applied inside `extract_cbd_data()` in `extractor.py`.

```
SELECT a KC ONLY IF:
  - The trainee directly demonstrated it in this specific case narrative
  - There is explicit textual evidence (e.g. "I intubated" → SLO3 KC1)

DO NOT SELECT if:
  - It could plausibly apply but isn't mentioned
  - The patient needed it but the trainee didn't personally do it
  - It's adjacent to what was described

Over-selection is a bug. Under-selection is safer. Max ~4 KCs per case.
```

---

## Data Flow

```
User input (text/voice/photo)
  ↓
bot.py — conversation state machine, Telegram handler
  ↓
extractor.py — Gemini API calls (classify, recommend, extract, humanize)
  ↓
context.user_data['draft'] — CBDData object in memory
  ↓ (after ✅ File this draft)
filer.py — browser-use + Chromium → Kaizen ePortfolio (draft saved)

SQLite DB (~/.openclaw/data/portfolio-guru/portfolio_guru.db)
  ↔ bot.py (read credentials, write case history in v2.1)

BWS secrets (at startup only):
  - Telegram bot token
  - Google API key (Gemini)
  - Fernet encryption key (for credentials)
```

---

## Hard Constraints (never violate)

- NEVER submit a form to supervisor — draft save only, every time
- NEVER submit/sign an assessor ticket without explicit approval for that one ticket and reviewed response
- NEVER create drafts, sign, submit, delete, approve, reject, or send feedback while running assessor mapping
- NEVER store credentials in plaintext — always Fernet-encrypt before writing to DB
- NEVER open Kaizen before the user taps [✅ File this draft]
- NEVER select a KC unless the trainee directly demonstrated it in this case
- Date format for Kaizen input fields: `d/m/yyyy` (not ISO 8601)
- KC over-selection is a correctness bug — err on the side of fewer

---

## User-Facing Message Standard

End-to-end reference for every bot bubble in `backend/bot.py`.
Safety-critical templates live in `backend/message_policy.py` and must not
drift from there — see [Safety-critical templates](#safety-critical-templates)
below.

### Message classes

Every user-facing string falls into exactly one class. The class determines
where the text lives, who can edit it, and what may flex by context.

| Class            | Lives in                           | Examples                                                                                                               | Allowed to vary?                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FIXED`          | `message_policy.MESSAGE_TEMPLATES` | welcome, captured ack, privacy nudge, AI unavailable, thin-case detail request, draft reply hint, file-case prompt     | No — copy is locked here and pulled via `render_message`. |
| `TEMPLATED`      | `message_policy.MESSAGE_TEMPLATES` | form recommendation (composed from rationales)                                                                         | Variable slots only.                                      |
| `LLM_ASSISTED`   | LLM output, post-filtered          | `answer_question`, `compose_filing_recovery_copy`, post-file `summarise_recent_activity`                               | Yes — bounded to low-risk explanation/recovery paths.     |
| `CONVERSATIONAL` | Inline in `bot.py`                 | Stage acks, slow-progress edits, mode-aware errors, filing outcomes, gate messages, button replies, recovery scaffolds | Yes — must follow the [Shape](#shape) and tables below.   |

If a `CONVERSATIONAL` line repeats verbatim in more than one handler, prefer
adding it to `message_policy.MESSAGE_TEMPLATES` rather than duplicating it.

### Shape

- One bot bubble per long async action. The first ack is edited in place as
  the action progresses — never followed by a separate "still working" bubble.
- One leading emoji per message, present-tense verb, en/em dashes for inline
  asides (`—`), ellipsis (`…`) for in-flight actions.
- Telegram's typing indicator (`_typing_until`) is the ambient progress
  signal for long work. Text reassurance is opt-in, sparing, and replaces
  the ack — it never adds a second line.
- Markdown only when `parse_mode="Markdown"` is also passed. Raw asterisks
  in plain-text bubbles are a bug — `plain_text_policy_violations()` in
  `message_policy.py` is the test surface for `FIXED` templates.

### Vocabulary by stage (new-case flow)

These are the canonical strings for the primary path: user sends a fresh
clinical case → bot extracts text → bot recommends forms. Other flows
reuse the acks and adjust the success/error recovery clauses (see
[Mode-aware error recovery](#mode-aware-error-recovery)).

| Stage                        | Photo                                                                       | Voice                                                                        | Video                                                                                  | Document                                                                                    | Kaizen save                                                                                                                                                                         |

Try a different file format or describe the case in text.` | `❌ Filing failed. Try again or start fresh.` (with retry / start-fresh buttons)                                                                                                    |

`NOT_CLINICAL` extraction (photo doesn't look clinical) gets its own
recovery line — `This image doesn't look like a clinical case. Send a text
description or a photo of clinical notes/findings.` — and ends the
conversation rather than retrying.

Media routing per state (from `build_application`):

- **New case** (`AWAIT_CASE_INPUT`): accepts text, voice, photo, document.
  Video is **not** routed here — the Video column above is the canonical
  Ack/Error wording for when video lands in a later state, not a new-case
  surface.
- **Template review** (`AWAIT_TEMPLATE_REVIEW`): accepts text, voice,
  photo, video, document.
- **Approval** (`AWAIT_APPROVAL`): accepts text, voice, photo, video,
  document.
- **Edit value** (`AWAIT_EDIT_VALUE`): accepts text plus a catch-all for
  voice/photo/document via `handle_edit_value`.

### Mode-aware error recovery

The cause clause stays the same regardless of flow; only the recovery
clause changes. Three flow modes:

| Flow mode                                              | Where it lives                                                 | Recovery clause                         | Why                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New case**                                           | `handle_case_input`                                            | `describe the case in text` (per media) | User hasn't picked a form yet — keep guiding toward providing case.  |
| **Template review** (form chosen, accumulating detail) | `handle_template_review_media` / `handle_template_review_text` | `Try again or send text.`               | We already have a partial template; text is the simplest next input. |
| **Existing draft** (preview shown, refining)           | `handle_approval_media_feedback` / `handle_edit_value`         | `Type your feedback instead.`           | User is editing a draft, not starting fresh.                         |
| **Voice profile setup**                                | `voice_collect_example`                                        | `Try pasting text instead.`             | Examples flow accepts paste; "case" framing doesn't apply.           |

Example: voice failure across the three primary modes:

```
new case        →  ⚠️ Couldn't transcribe voice note. Try again or describe the case in text.
template review →  ⚠️ Couldn't transcribe voice note. Try again or send text.
existing draft  →  ⚠️ Couldn't transcribe voice note. Type your feedback instead.
```

Apply the same pattern to image / video / document errors.

### Refining-existing-draft success vocabulary

When media is uploaded into an already-active flow, the success edit uses
"Got it — updating …":

| Flow                    | Success edit (replaces the ack)             | Where it lives                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Template review         | `Got it — updating template…` (per media)   | `handle_template_review_media`   |
| Existing draft feedback | `Got it — updating draft…` (per media)      | `handle_approval_media_feedback` |
| Edit value (legacy)     | `✏️ Regenerating draft with your feedback…` | `handle_edit_value`              |

Both `template` and `draft` framings are correct — they describe different
nouns. Keep them separate, but never have an ack say `updating template`
in a flow that's actually editing a draft.

### Slow-progress contract

For OCR, transcription, or filing that may take longer than the user's
patience window, follow the `_run_image_progress` pattern in `backend/bot.py`:

1. Send the initial ack once.
2. Schedule one replacement edit after a delay (`asyncio.Event` + `wait_for`).
3. Set the event before the success/error edit so the reassurance is
   suppressed when work finishes in time.
4. Cancel the task on the way out and swallow the resulting `CancelledError`.

Never concatenate `"\n"`-joined status lines onto the ack — that reads as
the bot repeating itself.

Two long-running surfaces use a richer progress sequence rather than a
single replacement, because the work has discrete phases:

- **Kaizen filing (`_filing_progress`):** three sequential edits at
  20 s / 60 s / 120 s — `Still saving…` → `Filling fields…` → `Verifying
the save…`. Each edit replaces the previous one. Catches any
  edit-throws-after-success and swallows them.
- **Kaizen login (`_progress_updates` in `setup_password`):** two
  sequential edits at 15 s / 35 s — `Still checking — Kaizen can be slow
to respond…` → `Almost there — finalising the login check…`.

### Errors (general rules)

- One ⚠️ line per error. State the cause in present tense (`Couldn't read
image`), then a one-clause recovery (see [Mode-aware error recovery]
  (#mode-aware-error-recovery)). No stack traces, no apologies, no
  "please".
- Hard failures that lose the draft use ❌ (e.g. `❌ Filing failed.`,
  `❌ Login failed — please check your username and password.`); recoverable
  warnings use ⚠️.
- Timeout uses ⏱ (`⏱ Filing took too long.`, `⏱ Kaizen took too long to
respond.`); button/state expiry uses ⏳ (`⏳ Quick improve timed out.`,
  `⏳ Template review timed out. Please try again.`).
- After an error that keeps the draft alive, the recovery message must be
  paired with a keyboard the user can act on — usually `🔄 Try Again` plus
  either `🆕 Start fresh` or `❌ Cancel`. A dead-end ⚠️ with no buttons is a
  bug.

### Pre-save gate (Save as draft)

When the user taps **Save as draft** the bot checks the draft against the
DOPS quality gate before calling Kaizen. The gate has two tiers:

- **Blocking (genuinely unsafe / near-empty draft).** The procedure name is
  absent, or the narrative slot has no clinical substance at all (thin
  `case_observed` AND both `indication` and `trainee_performance` empty).
  The bot sends a fresh `🟡 *{form_name} needs a bit more detail before I
file it.*` message with the missing fields and the Save / Quick improve /
  Cancel keyboard. The reviewed draft preview stays visible.
- **Warning (recoverable gap, save proceeds).** Missing date, missing
  stage, one missing semantic block, or rough reflection wording. The bot
  sends a fresh `🟡 *Saving {form_name} despite some gaps.* Add these in
Kaizen after the save:` message and then calls the filer normally. The
  reviewed draft preview stays visible; the user remains in control of
  their explicit Save.

Both tiers always arrive as **new messages**, never by editing the
reviewed draft preview — the user just approved that preview and should
not lose the context they were looking at.

### Filing outcomes (after Kaizen save returns)

The progress message edits one last time with the final outcome — the
reviewed draft preview always stays visible above. Outcome shapes:

| Status                 | Headline                                                      | Body                                                                                                  | Keyboard                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `success`              | `✅ *{form_name} saved.*` + SLO/date summary                  | Field count, usage line, optional one-line `💡 {observation}`                                         | `📋 File another` / `🔁 Same case, another WPBA` / `✏️ Amend this draft` |
| `partial` (with error) | `⚠️ *{form_name} — filing had issues.*`                       | `{n} fields filled.` + LLM-composed recovery clause + `[Open … in Kaizen]({url})` + proof report      | `🔄 Try again` / `🆕 Start fresh`                                        |
| `partial` (no error)   | `⚠️ *{form_name} saved as a draft, but needs manual review.*` | Filled + skipped count + `Open Kaizen to fill the missing detail, then assign an assessor.`           | Post-file follow-up keyboard                                             |
| `failed`               | `❌ *Filing didn't complete — Failed / blocked.*`             | LLM recovery clause + `[Open {form_name} manually in Kaizen]({url})` + proof report                   | `🔄 Try again` / `🆕 Start fresh`                                        |
| Timeout                | `⏱ Filing took too long.`                                     | `The draft might be in your activities list already — [open Kaizen]({url}) to check before retrying.` | Stays on `AWAIT_APPROVAL` so the user can retry                          |

The proof report at the bottom of partial/failed states is generated by
`_format_proof_report` and lists status, source, fields completed, skipped
fields, and "Not done: no supervisor request sent, no final submission
made" — it is the trust layer and should never be dropped.

Conversation-state invariant: every path to `ConversationHandler.END` must
call `context.user_data.clear()` first. The cancel/recovery surfaces above
all enforce this.

### Button / control vocabulary

Used across keyboards in `bot.py`. Keep these exact — the emoji and label
together carry meaning and downstream copy refers to them by name.

| Button label                      | Callback                         | Where                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `🔗 Connect Kaizen`               | `ACTION\|setup`                  | Welcome, missing-credentials surfaces    |
| `❌ Cancel`                       | `ACTION\|cancel` (and others)    | Universal cancel                         |
| `📤 Save as draft`                | `APPROVE\|draft`                 | Approval keyboard                        |
| `✨ Quick improve`                | `IMPROVE\|reflection`            | Approval keyboard (single-use per draft) |
| `✏️ Edit` / `✏️ Amend this draft` | `APPROVE\|edit` / `AMEND\|amend` | Approval / post-file keyboards           |
| `📋 File another case`            | `ACTION\|file`                   | Post-file keyboard                       |
| `🔁 Same case, another WPBA`      | `ACTION\|same_case_another`      | Post-success keyboard                    |
| `📝 Review draft` (Unlimited)     | `REVIEW\|draft`                  | Approval keyboard (gated tier)           |
| `🔄 Try again`                    | `ACTION\|retry_filing`           | Filing error / partial keyboards         |
| `🆕 Start fresh`                  | `ACTION\|reset`                  | Filing error keyboards                   |
| `🔙 Back`                         | `ACTION\|back_to_menu`           | Sub-views (settings, health, help, info) |

### Safety-critical templates

These stay fixed in `backend/message_policy.py` (`MessageClass.FIXED`),
behind `render_message(key)`:

- `welcome_disconnected`, `welcome_connected` — first-touch framing.
- `what_is_this` — opt-in explanation.
- `file_case_prompt` — the "send what happened" prompt.
- `captured_ack` — the bridging ack after a case is received.
- `thin_case_detail_request` — anti-fabrication guard for empty inputs.
- `ai_temporarily_unavailable` — LLM-down fallback.
- `photo_privacy_nudge` — appended to recommendations after a photo input.
- `draft_reply_hint` — appended to draft previews (`_REPLY_HINT_SUFFIX`).
- `form_recommendation` (TEMPLATED) — the recommendation message body.

LLM-assisted prose is allowed only on explicitly low-risk explanation/
recovery paths: `answer_question`, `compose_filing_recovery_copy`,
`summarise_recent_activity`. Never let the LLM author safety-critical
copy (welcome, privacy, captured ack, thin-case detail).

### Intentional exceptions / non-drift cases

These look like drift but are correct as-is — don't normalise without
talking to Moeed first.

- `Got it — updating template…` vs `Got it — updating draft…` — different
  flow nouns (template review vs existing draft). Both are correct.
- `📷 Reading image…` vs `📷 Reading images…` — the plural is intentional
  during bundle mode (`pending_case_bundle`), where multiple photos arrive
  in one window.
- `🎙️ Transcribing…` inside `voice_collect_example` may stay generic if
  the surrounding context already establishes "voice example" framing;
  prefer `🎙️ Transcribing voice note…` otherwise.
- Setup-login error `Try again — or send the case anyway, you can connect
later.` deliberately offers two recovery paths because the user might
  want to file before fixing credentials.
